## What is BridgeTs?

BridgeTs is a new Node.js framework built on Express.js that uses the power of Typescript to generate the code for the client. 

In other words, its goal is that the backend developers won't have to manually write API documentation or to maintain a Postman collection to keep the client up-to-date with the API.

## Getting Started

We recommend creating a new **BridgeTS** app using *create-bridgeTS-app*, which sets up everything automatically for you. 

To create a project, run:

```
npx create-bridge-app
# or
yarn create next-app
```

After the installation is complete:
- Run *npm run dev* or *yarn dev* or to start the development server on http://localhost:8080
- Run *npm run build* or *yarn build* to build the static files for production
- Run *npm run start* or *yarn start* to start the production server on http://localhost:3000
